  - Collaborate with developers to maintain high standards of code quality, offering guidance and feedback during code reviews.
  - Implement and maintain coding standards, ensuring consistency across the codebase.
- **Technical Leadership:**
  - Provide technical direction for the parts of the codebase they own, making key decisions on architecture, refactoring, and technology adoption.
  - Work closely with GitHub Repository Owners/Administrators to ensure that code-related decisions align with the overall public repository governance and organizational policies.

### 4. Code Contributors:
**Responsibilities:**
- **Policy Adherence:**
  - Follow the access control policies and procedures when contributing to public GitHub repositories.
- **Account Security:**
  - Secure their GitHub accounts with strong, unique passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- **Role-Specific Access:**
  - Request access levels appropriate to their role and responsibilities, whether as a regular contributor or a guest contributor.
- **Code Review and Contribution:**
  - Adhere to established guidelines for code reviews, pull requests, and commits to maintain code integrity and security.
  - Ensure that all contributions meet the public repository’s quality and security standards, regardless of whether they are made by internal team members or third-party contributors.

## 5. Management Commitment
Management, through the GitHub Organization Owners, is committed to ensuring the security and integrity of our public GitHub repositories. This includes providing the necessary resources, tools, and training to implement and enforce this access control policy. Regular reviews will be conducted to ensure the effectiveness of this policy and adjust as needed to address evolving security threats and organizational needs.

## 6. Coordination Among Organizational Entities
Effective coordination between the GitHub Organization Owners, Repository Owners/Administrators, Code Owners, and Code Contributors is essential for maintaining a secure and compliant public GitHub environment. Regular meetings will be held to review access controls, discuss any issues or incidents, and ensure that all parties are aligned with the policy’s objectives.

## 7. Compliance
This policy complies with the Government of Canada’s security guidelines, including NIST SP 800-53, and other relevant departmental standards. It is subject to regular review and updates to maintain compliance with evolving regulations and organizational requirements.

## 8. Approval and Review
This policy is reviewed annually or as needed based on changes in regulations, organizational structure, or the security landscape. All updates must be approved by the GitHub Organization Owners before implementation.
