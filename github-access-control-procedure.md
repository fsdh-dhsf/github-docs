# Access Control Procedure for Implementing GitHub Repository Access Control Policy

## 1. Purpose
This document provides the step-by-step procedures to implement the Access Control Policy for public GitHub repositories managed by our organization. These procedures ensure that access to our repositories is secure, appropriately managed, and aligned with our organizational policies.

## 2. Scope
This procedure applies to all roles involved in managing, contributing to, or accessing our public GitHub repositories, including GitHub Organization Owners, Repository Owners/Administrators, Code Owners, and Code Contributors.

## 3. Access Control Procedures

### 3.1. User Access Requests

1. **Requesting Access:**
   - New users or contributors must submit an access request via the designated communication channel (e.g., email or an internal ticketing system).
   - The request should include the user’s GitHub username, the specific repository they need access to, and the level of access required (e.g., read-only, contributor, admin).

2. **Approval Process:**
   - **Repository Owners/Administrators** review the request, ensuring the requested access aligns with the user’s role and responsibilities.
   - If the request is approved, the Repository Owner/Administrator grants the appropriate level of access within GitHub.
   - If necessary, consult with **GitHub Organization Owners** for access requests that require higher privileges or if the request is for a new type of role.

3. **Notification:**
   - The user is notified of their access approval and provided with any relevant guidelines or instructions.

### 3.2. Access Levels and Permissions

1. **Assigning Access Levels:**
   - **GitHub Organization Owners** ensure that all users are assigned the appropriate roles (e.g., Repository Admin, Maintainer, Code Owner) based on their responsibilities.
   - **Repository Owners/Administrators** manage day-to-day access control for specific repositories, including granting or revoking permissions such as write access, code review permissions, or repository admin rights.

2. **Use of GitHub Teams:**
   - Organize users into GitHub Teams for efficient access management. For example:
     - **Admins Team:** Full admin access to specific repositories.
     - **Maintainers Team:** Write access and permission to manage branches.
     - **Contributors Team:** Write access but limited to contributing code via pull requests.

### 3.3. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Enforcement

1. **Enforcing MFA:**
   - All users must enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on their GitHub accounts.
   - **GitHub Organization Owners** enforce this setting within the organization’s security settings to ensure compliance.

2. **Monitoring Compliance:**
   - **Repository Owners/Administrators** and **GitHub Organization Owners** regularly monitor compliance with the MFA requirement.
   - Users found without MFA enabled are prompted to secure their accounts immediately. Non-compliant accounts may have their access temporarily suspended until MFA is enabled.

### 3.4. Repository and Code Management

1. **Branch Protection Rules:**
   - **Repository Owners/Administrators** configure branch protection rules to enforce code reviews before merging, requiring status checks to pass, and restricting who can push to certain branches.
   - Use of required reviews ensures that **Code Owners** are automatically requested to review changes to the code they are responsible for.

2. **CODEOWNERS File:**
   - Implement the `CODEOWNERS` file in each repository to define who is responsible for specific parts of the codebase.
   - This ensures that relevant **Code Owners** are automatically assigned to review and approve changes to their areas of responsibility.

3. **Secret Management:**
   - All secrets (e.g., API keys, tokens) must be stored securely using GitHub’s secret management features.
   - **Repository Owners/Administrators** are responsible for managing and rotating secrets as needed, ensuring that they are not exposed in the codebase.

### 3.5. Regular Security Audits

1. **Audit Scheduling:**
   - **GitHub Organization Owners** and **Repository Owners/Administrators** schedule regular security audits, at least quarterly, to review access logs, repository settings, and user permissions.

2. **Audit Process:**
   - Conduct reviews of access logs to identify any unauthorized access or suspicious activities.
   - Verify that all repositories comply with organizational security policies, including branch protection, MFA enforcement, and secret management.
   - Address any identified security gaps immediately and document the actions taken.

3. **Reporting:**
   - Compile audit findings into a report and share it with relevant stakeholders, including **Code Owners** and **GitHub Organization Owners**.

### 3.6. Incident Response

1. **Incident Detection:**
   - In the event of a suspected security incident (e.g., unauthorized access, data breach), immediately notify **GitHub Organization Owners** and **Repository Owners/Administrators**.
   - **GitHub Organization Owners** initiate the incident response process, leveraging the departmental incident response plan, which includes containment, investigation, and remediation steps.

2. **Containment:**
   - Temporarily revoke access for affected users or repositories if necessary to prevent further unauthorized actions.
   - Review and update access controls to close any security vulnerabilities.

3. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the cause and scope of the incident.
   - Work with **Code Owners** and relevant technical experts to assess any impact on the codebase or repositories.

4. **Remediation and Communication:**
   - Implement necessary remediation actions, such as rolling back changes, restoring repositories, or enhancing security measures.
   - Communicate the outcome of the incident response to all affected parties, including any changes to access controls or security practices.

## 4. Review and Maintenance

- **Procedure Review:** This procedure document is reviewed annually or as needed based on changes in organizational policies, security practices, or the GitHub platform.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Feedback from **GitHub Organization Owners**, **Repository Owners/Administrators**, **Code Owners**, and **Code Contributors** is incorporated to continuously improve access control procedures.
